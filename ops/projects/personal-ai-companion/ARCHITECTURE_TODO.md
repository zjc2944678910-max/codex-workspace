# Personal AI Companion Architecture TODO

## Near Term

- Completed 2026-07-04: initial FastAPI/Python + SQLite local skeleton under
  `projects/products/personal-ai-companion`.
- Completed 2026-07-04: first `InteractionEnvelope`, `IdentityKernel`,
  `PrivacyKernel`, `MemoryStore`, `MemoryService`, and mock `ModelRouter`.
- Completed 2026-07-04: local endpoints for `/v1/chat`, `/v1/admin/usage`,
  `/v1/memory/ingest`, `/v1/memory/recall`, `/v1/memory/search`,
  `/v1/memory/{id}/explain`, promote, reject, and delete.
- Completed 2026-07-04: unit tests for identity binding, privacy scopes,
  StackChan speaker delivery, owner-confirmed memory promotion/deletion, and
  mock model routing.
- Completed 2026-07-05: isolated `.venv` with FastAPI/uvicorn/httpx/pytest.
- Completed 2026-07-05: real local API smoke on `127.0.0.1:8767` for
  `/v1/chat`, consent grant, review queue, memory promote, and memory recall.
- Completed 2026-07-05: `review_items` and `consent_records` are first-class
  SQLite tables with service/API coverage.
- Completed 2026-07-05: local Mac Ollama adapter wired for private local-first
  chat, defaulting to `huihui_ai/qwen3.5-abliterated:9b`; `qwen2.5vl:7b`
  reserved as the visual model.
- Completed 2026-07-05: architecture decision set to Mac for local model
  inference and NAS for memory/search/backup/always-on storage.
- Completed 2026-07-05: OpenAI-compatible cloud relay adapter added for
  Gemini/Claude routes, configured only by environment variables and no
  committed provider secrets.
- Completed 2026-07-05: verified Sub2API `/v1/models`; default companion cloud
  route changed to `claude-sonnet-4-6` because Claude/Opus relay smokes passed
  while Gemini 3.5 Flash variants returned upstream location errors.
- Next: decide whether to keep SQLite for the next iteration or introduce a
  migration layer before adding embeddings.
- Next: add explicit DB migration/versioning before the schema grows further.
- Next: configure the real relay base URL/API key locally and run a non-secret
  cloud model smoke test.

## Later

- Add STT/TTS and StackChan device registration.
- Add Memory Admin UI/API.
- Add iOS app permission flows for HealthKit/EventKit/AlarmKit/App Intents.
- Add NAS memory/vector persistence plan.
- Add chat-log import and consented style profile pipeline.

## Decisions To Revisit

- Database choice: Postgres + pgvector vs SQLite for the first local MVP.
- Embedding model and vector dimensions.
- Whether StackChan should stream audio directly or upload utterance chunks.
- Whether NAS should handle embeddings, summarization, or only storage/search.
- How explicit consent should be captured for style-profile training/import.
