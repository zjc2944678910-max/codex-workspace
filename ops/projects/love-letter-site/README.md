## Stable Docs

- `README.md`

- `ARCHITECTURE_TODO.md` when architecture backlog exists
- `manifests/`
- `reports/`
- `runbooks/`

## Subdirectories

- `manifests/`: tracked operator manifests and inventory notes
- `reports/`: tracked durable project reports and audit writeups
- `runbooks/`: tracked project-specific operational procedures
- `mirrors/`: local mirrors of service units, tools, and runtime artifacts
- `evidence/`: timestamped evidence bundles for audits and repairs
- `rollback/`: timestamped rollback bundles for reversible change sets
- `logs/`: time-bucketed operator logs
- `quarantine/`: legacy artifacts or uncertain evidence retained locally

`mirrors/`, `evidence/`, `logs/`, `quarantine/`, and `rollback/` are
local-only by default and are not part of the workspace-index repository
surface.
